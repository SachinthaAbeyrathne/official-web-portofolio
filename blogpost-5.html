                 It has been a month since I started my journey studying at the <a href="https://www.westminster.ac.uk/">University of Westminster UK</a> as an Undergraduate Student from Sri Lanka 🇱🇰. Since my Childhood I had the dream to do something big especially when it came to my Higher Studies and Traveling Abroad. I have always been fascinated by making me even more eager to explore other Countries and Cultures as well while connected with my Sri Lankan roots.</h3>
 <br><br>
 <h3><b> Why Not Sri Lanka?</b></h3>
 Due to the current economic crisis and political unrest in Sri Lanka, though we have
universities that offer Bachelor's Degrees most of the courses are Offered Online and thankfully now institutions started delivering lectures  Physically Again after the Long Fuel Crisis. At that time doing Online
Study methods do not give the expected standards as a consequence of Long Hour Power Outages which we faced few months back.<br><br>

Taking all these reasons into Consideration my parents have encouraged me to have pursue
my Higher Studies at an overseas university where I have done my foundation program locally at <a href="https://www.iit.ac.lk/">Informatics Institute of technology, Sri Lanka.</a>
which was partnered with the University of Westminster and throughout my foundation, I
was looking forward to doing my Degree at the University of Westminster UK which I was
offered an Unconditional Placement. Therefore, I decided to move to the UK where they
offer many opportunities for International students as an Education Hub where <b> will be able
to expand my professional network and bring back all the experience, knowledge, and
exposure to my home country and share with budding young talents.</b><br><br>

 <h3><b> Why did I choose the UK for my Higher Studies?</b></h3>
 Before I chose the UK for my studies I researched other Countries too. As a foundation
student, I found it very attractive and subject-orientated. The United Kingdom consistently
ranks among the finest countries in the world, and it is now the best country in terms of
quality of life. Studying in the UK will provide a globally recognized education from some of
the world's best instructors and academics. The most important factor I’ve found in the UK
Education system is that the courses they offer are shorter and more intensive than in many
other countries.<br><br>
For me, the possibility of studying and living in the UK for the duration of my term is
incredibly exciting. The United Kingdom is a remarkable place for overseas students to grow
and develop themselves. Key interpersonal abilities and sophisticated communication skills
will be developed, which will pave the road for a successful entrepreneurial career for me.
Apart from that, the country's diverse population's welcoming and loving attitude will allow
me to acquire and progress in vital life skills.<br><br>
 <h3><b> Reasons for me to Choose the University of Westminster UK.</b></h3>            
 The specific reason for me to select the University of Westminster with my research, I have found that studying at the University of Westminster UK means that the Classrooms go well beyond the walls of the University and everything that London has to offer is on the doorstep. I chose the University of Westminster over several other universities in the UK. <br> <br> Besides, the university of Westminster boasts a rich history and has been providing students with academic excellence, cultural engagement and personal enrichment since its inception as the Polytechnic Institution in 1838. The University of Westminster has been ranked 20th in the world and 6th in the UK for international students in 2021 by the Times Higher Education
 World Rankings. Westminster will allow me to have access to a variety of opportunities, tools. In addition, the UK is well known as a multicultural country and this will
 allow me to mix with different cultural students. Also, I have come to know that a UK
 University education is recognized by Employers and Governments Worldwide. Academic
 standards are of high prestige and the education will provide me with a solid foundation to
 boost my potential for having a higher salary and competitive edge in the modern Job Market.
<br><br> During my Foundation Studies, I found that my passion for the Business and Information
 Technology fields will give me Technical and Analytical skills as well as the ability to assess,
 evaluate, and communicate the key aspects of IS/IT as an enabler of Modern Organizations
 which the University of Westminster offers many comprehensive modules which will prepare
 me a for Global Career.
 and resources, as well as dedicated career support, to enhance my employability.
 <br><br>
 <h3><b>Here are some important advices for anyone planning to study abroad to consider:</b></h3>
 <br>
1) Research the country: Going to a great college might pave your way to a high-paying job, but in a country of crisis, money might not be able to solve your issues. Read about what is the situation in the country you are planning to move to, some important things to look at are, Inflation rate, Unemployment rate, Escalation of housing prices and employee satisfaction surveys. 
<br><br>
2) The processes are different: I can speak very confidently for the United Kingdom. Food and delivery systems are not common and super expensive. From the transportation system to "How to activate your SIM card", these things can seem minor, but they can save you money (the UK has lots of student discount schemes), time and peace to know about them beforehand. 
<br><br>
3) Most Importantly Engage and Network with the Right People (which is really important to all) who can guide in both career and personal life. Join Workshops and career events to enhance the knowledge and upskill
<br><br>
